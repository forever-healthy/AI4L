## Version

* Check all [project_files] version numbers
* Use the version stated in the `VERSION` file in the project root as a reference.
* Make sure that all targets are consistent with it, including the version in the badges.
* Some files do not have badges, just the version in the text. Make sure those are consistent as well.
* If a file has no version, leave it as it is

## Consistency Checking

* Check all target files for consistency and completeness
* Check the numbering of all items and the item count in AI4L.md

# Reporting

* If there are any inconsistencies, report them and ask the user if you should fix them.
* Report what was fixed (if anything).
